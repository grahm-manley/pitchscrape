class="row"><div class="clearfix"><div class="abstract"><p>The Scottish group\xe2\x80\x99s 1989 cult classic is an album of euphoric love and loss that unfolds slowly and with starry eyes. Its noir mood and icy melodrama are still felt all over modern pop.</p>\n</div></div><div class="clearfix flex-md"><div class="review-text clearfix"><div class="contents dropcap"><p>Paul Buchanan, the elusive and self-deprecating frontman of Scottish pop group <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/24959-the-blue-nile/">the Blue Nile</a>, once compared making records to falling in love. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t do it every year,\xe2\x80\x9d he elaborated. Since forming in 1981, the Blue Nile have released only four albums, each one followed by a long period of silence. Their music is patient and understated. Their songs mostly explore the trajectory of relationships, from their glittery beginnings to their plateaus of contentment and their exhausted, haunted finales. Their stories are set in the smoky locales of noir: in ragtown, shantytown, tinseltown. It\xe2\x80\x99s usually raining. To listen passively to the Blue Nile is to ride in a taxi through the city at night as familiar scenes blur outside your window.</p>\n<p>To listen closely to the Blue Nile is to become a part of the scenery. In this way, Buchanan\xe2\x80\x99s metaphor about the time between albums comes alive. The long gestation of each record suggests, as in the early stages of a relationship, a sharpening of the senses, getting lost in a world that\xe2\x80\x99s getting smaller around you. You want to do it right this time. The Blue Nile\xe2\x80\x99s music also <em>sounds</em> like falling in love, slow and starry-eyed, with melodies that fizzle and glow like streetlights. By the time they released their sophomore album, <em>Hats</em>, in the autumn of 1989, Buchanan was 33 years old, and his songs, once littered with bold declarations of love, now seemed to be composed entirely of ellipses and question marks.</p>\n<p>The members of the Blue Nile met while they were students at the University of Glasgow. After graduating and easing into an uninspiring teaching gig, Buchanan says he and his friends turned to music in search of a career that they \xe2\x80\x9ccould be instinctive about.\xe2\x80\x9d With Buchanan on guitar and vocals, Paul Joseph \xe2\x80\x9cPJ\xe2\x80\x9d Moore on keyboards and synth, and Robert Bell on bass, they recruited a drum machine as their fourth member.</p>\n<p>The Blue Nile\xe2\x80\x99s first single\xe2\x80\x941981\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cI Love This Life\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is a catchy song about an up-and-coming rock band doomed to remain a cult act. Dreaming of adoring crowds and hit records, Buchanan sings with appropriate joie de vivre, but even on his first single, he sounds more like a veteran actor portraying a teenager. He has the type of pained, dignified voice, like <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/5095-frank-sinatra/">Frank Sinatra</a> or <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/696-johnny-cash/">Johnny Cash</a>, that makes it hard to imagine him ever actually being young. \xe2\x80\x9cI know I\xe2\x80\x99m going out of style,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings and immediately asks, \xe2\x80\x9cAm I already out of style?\xe2\x80\x9d The song, paired with a downbeat B-side called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Second Act,\xe2\x80\x9d became a self-fulfilling prophecy as the band continued in relative obscurity.</p>\n<p>Their debut album, <em>A Walk Across the Rooftops</em>, arrived in 1984 via the stereo equipment company Linn, who were looking to expand their reach by starting a label. (\xe2\x80\x9cLinn weren\xe2\x80\x99t a record company and we weren\xe2\x80\x99t a band,\xe2\x80\x9d Buchanan would later reflect in Elliot J. Huntley and Edith Hall\xe2\x80\x99s biography <em>From a Late Night Train</em>.) Still, their unusual working relationship allowed the members of the Blue Nile to record in Linn\xe2\x80\x99s studios and operate without a strict deadline. As so often happens with our first brushes of love, the band chased this experience the rest of their career. No pressure and no expectations\xe2\x80\x94a creative process they could be instinctive about.</p>\n<p>Whittled down to seven songs, <em>A Walk Across the Rooftops</em> is a stately record that established the Blue Nile\xe2\x80\x99s sound\xe2\x80\x94a sprawling, sophisticated strain of ambient synth pop\xe2\x80\x94and their major themes. \xe2\x80\x9cI am in love with a feeling,\xe2\x80\x9d Buchanan sings in \xe2\x80\x9cFrom Rags to Riches.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIs there a place in this city/A place to always feel this way,\xe2\x80\x9d he asks in \xe2\x80\x9cTinseltown in the Rain,\xe2\x80\x9d a minor hit in Holland and the closest thing the Blue Nile have to a signature song. The album, punctuated by Bell\xe2\x80\x99s slap bass and a vibrant backdrop of keys and guitars, dazzled critics and established a small audience of devoted fans.</p>\n<p>Instead of rushing to make a follow-up, the Blue Nile studied where their music had taken them, as they traveled through America and Europe. \xe2\x80\x9c[O]ne of the best things we saw in our first trip to London,\xe2\x80\x9d Buchanan told <em>NME</em> after the album\xe2\x80\x99s release, \xe2\x80\x9cWas a guy and a girl standing in Oxford Street\xe2\x80\xa6 They were obviously having a moment\xe2\x80\x94breaking up or something, something that was wrong\xe2\x80\x94and you just looked at it and knew the feeling. It was a brilliant reminder of what\xe2\x80\x99s worth all the hassle.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>It was an omen. The five years between <em>A Walk Across the Rooftops</em> and <em>Hats</em> were trying times for the band. Relationships, both romantic and professional, crumbled around them. An album\xe2\x80\x99s worth of material was scrapped\xe2\x80\x94the feeling just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there\xe2\x80\x94and the tapes were burned. Witnessing the dissolution of his parents\xe2\x80\x99 decades-long marriage, Buchanan\xe2\x80\x99s writing became increasingly sparse and tormented, like Raymond Carver stories stretched into the shape of torch ballads.</p>\n<p>At his mother\xe2\x80\x99s house, Buchanan tracked a new song called \xe2\x80\x9cChristmas\xe2\x80\x9d that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t end up making the record. Its lyrics are a portrait of the least romantic kind of adult despair: money running out, children crying. But the song is a balm, smoother and sweeter than anything the band had ever recorded. At one point, Buchanan plays an uncharacteristic guitar solo and hums along sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cTake it easy,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings as if to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI still love you. I believe in you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>This is the tone of <em>Hats</em>: a series of hard-won love songs written like no one was in the room. Despite its long incubation, the music arrived fairly quickly once the band established its arc. The song that opened the creative floodgates was \xe2\x80\x9cThe Downtown Lights,\xe2\x80\x9d a rush of images and emotions that flows at the deliberate pace of a steady walk through snow. Buchanan\xe2\x80\x99s guitar has hints of <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/29395-nile-rodgers/">Nile Rodgers</a>\xe2\x80\x99 palm-muted funk; Bell\xe2\x80\x99s bass slides where it once popped. By the end of the song, Buchanan is bellowing and the band is locked into an airtight stride, accompanied by a string section woven so closely to the lyrics you might think they\xe2\x80\x99re daydreaming it.</p>\n<p>Despite the movement of the music, <em>Hats</em> is an album in stasis. The Blue Nile understand that, like all good theater, relationships are inextricably linked to their setting, and the characters on <em>Hats</em> are prisoners to it, escaping only in fantasy. \xe2\x80\x9cWalk me into town/The ferry will be there to carry us away into the air,\xe2\x80\x9d Buchanan sings in \xe2\x80\x9cOver the Hillside.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s walk in the cool evening light/Wrong or right/Be at my side,\xe2\x80\x9d he pleads in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Downtown Lights.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI pray for love coming out all right,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings in the climactic final verse of \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s Go Out Tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he cries out the title as one final desperate attempt to save something that\xe2\x80\x99s already gone.</p>\n<p>The magic of <em>Hats</em> is how the music makes defeat sound euphoric. Depending on your mood, <em>Hats</em> can be an uplifting album (\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right\xe2\x80\x9d serves as its rallying cry) or a uniquely devastating one. These are multi-dimensional portraits: colorful cities populated by lonely people, romantic gestures received by silence, beautiful evenings going nowhere. The most immediate tracks on the album shift between moods like a plane dipping through clouds. \xe2\x80\x9cHeadlights on the Parade\xe2\x80\x9d rides its glowing new wave groove while Buchanan prods a lover that something isn\xe2\x80\x99t right. \xe2\x80\x9cOver the Hillside\xe2\x80\x9d begins with a sad hospital pulse and his depictions of a long, sleepless night, but it transcends to feel like an invitation, like elegance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5kXnq5IjdU">Thunder Road</a>\xe2\x80\x9d in a luxury car. \xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow I will be there,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings proudly at the end, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you wait and see.\xe2\x80\x9d On some listens, you believe him.</p>\n<p>The Blue Nile are a band whose criticisms only draw fans closer. Sure, all their songs are about love. Yes, they have erred on the side of adult contemporary. It\xe2\x80\x99s true that, in the \xe2\x80\x9990s, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JXEbVXoRhg">Rod Stewart</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-CJmYOL-U">Michael McDonald</a> sang Buchanan\xe2\x80\x99s words as comfortably as their own. But just as <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/534-big-star/">Big Star</a> became a symbol for the fame-averse underdog ideals of \xe2\x80\x9990s indie rock, the Blue Nile have proven newly influential. You can hear their heavenly chill on recent albums by <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/1068-destroyer/">Destroyer</a>; their lowercase romance in <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/">the xx</a>; their intense intimacy in <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/30868-majical-cloudz/">Majical Cloudz</a>. When Buchanan joined <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/29991-jessie-ware/">Jessie Ware</a> to co-write a track on last year\xe2\x80\x99s <em><a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jessie-ware-glasshouse/">Glasshouse</a></em>, it became clear how his band\xe2\x80\x99s work had been reflected in pop music\xe2\x80\x99s patient, moody turns.</p>\n<p>While their influence has long run deep, with outspoken fans including <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/575-vashti-bunyan/">Vashti Bunyan</a>, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/6496-phil-collins/">Phil Collins</a>, and <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/30622-the-1975/">the 1975</a>, to this day nothing sounds quite like <em>Hats</em>. The Blue Nile themselves never quite replicated it, opting for a loose, soulful atmosphere on 1996\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Peace At Last</em> and a more sober approach for 2004\xe2\x80\x99s <em>High</em>. Its closest companion is Paul Buchanan\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 solo album <em>Mid Air</em>\xe2\x80\x94a collection of near-demos on piano that further refined his sunken vignettes. \xe2\x80\x9cTear stains on your pillow,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings in \xe2\x80\x9cWedding Party,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI was drunk when I danced with the bride.\xe2\x80\x9d The stories\xe2\x80\x94as with most concerning the Blue Nile\xe2\x80\x94are between the lines.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s a shame that <em>Hats</em> was never a hit, but it also would have been a shame if it were. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine being confronted by these songs in the wild. It seems inappropriate to even listen to it in the daytime. You carve out a place to hear <em>Hats</em>; you confide it in other people. An oft-repeated legend about the band involves Paul Buchanan at a Glasgow bar shortly after the release of their debut album. As he downs a few pints among the locals, the conversation turns to music, and someone recommends him a great new band from the area. They\xe2\x80\x99re called the Blue Nile, they say. You\xe2\x80\x99ll love them, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got their tape in my car.</p>\n<p>The anecdote illustrates the overarching philosophy for Buchanan\xe2\x80\x99s art, to be removed from it completely. \xe2\x80\x9c[Y]ou hope that someday in the future some kid will be walking along the beach and find a little piece of green glass that has been worn down by the waves,\xe2\x80\x9d he once explained to <em>The Sydney Morning Herald</em>. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll pick it up and put it in his pocket, take it home and love it. He won\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily know why he loves it, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll love it. Those are the kind of records we try to make.\xe2\x80\x9d In another version of this metaphor, he relates a boy and a girl watching a film on their first date: \xe2\x80\x9cThey are much more important to each other, hopefully, than the movie is to either one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>At the core of <em>Hats</em> is a heartbroken song called \xe2\x80\x9cFrom a Late Night Train,\xe2\x80\x9d featuring just piano, trumpet, and Buchanan\xe2\x80\x99s vocals, all combining to sound like rain on the windshield of a parked car. \xe2\x80\x9cI know it\xe2\x80\x99s over,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings in a low, beaten voice, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I love you so.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s a song that illustrates the stakes of love, sung in the final moments of a relationship when there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing left to say but the inevitable. On a record filled with questions\xe2\x80\x94Where is the love? What\xe2\x80\x99s so wrong tonight?

Since forming in 1981, the Blue Nile have released only four albums, each one followed by a long period of silence. Their music is patient and understated. Their songs mostly explore the trajectory of relationships, from their glittery beginnings to their plateaus of contentment and their exhausted, haunted finales. Their stories are set in the smoky locales of noir: in ragtown, shantytown, tinseltown. It\xe2\x80\x99s usually raining. To listen passively to the Blue Nile is to ride in a taxi through the city at night as familiar scenes blur outside your window.\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ETo listen closely to the Blue Nile is to become a part of the scenery. In this way, Buchanan\xe2\x80\x99s metaphor about the time between albums comes alive. The long gestation of each record suggests, as in the early stages of a relationship, a sharpening of the senses, getting lost in a world that\xe2\x80\x99s getting smaller around you. You want to do it right this time. The Blue Nile\xe2\x80\x99s music also \\u003Cem\\u003Esounds\\u003C\\u002Fem\\u003E like falling in love, slow and starry-eyed, with melodies that fizzle and glow like streetlights. By the time they released their sophomore album, \\u003Cem\\u003EHats\\u003C\\u002Fem\\u003E, in the autumn of 1989, Buchanan was 33 years old, and his songs, once littered with bold declarations of love, now seemed to be composed entirely of ellipses and question marks.\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe members of the Blue Nile met while they were students at the University of Glasgow. After graduating and easing into an uninspiring teaching gig, Buchanan says he and his friends turned to music in search of a career that they \xe2\x80\x9ccould be instinctive about.\xe2\x80\x9d With Buchanan on guitar and vocals, Paul Joseph \xe2\x80\x9cPJ\xe2\x80\x9d Moore on keyboards and synth, and Robert Bell on bass, they recruited a drum machine as their fourth member.\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe Blue Nile\xe2\x80\x99s first single\xe2\x80\x941981\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cI Love This Life\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is a catchy song about an up-and-coming rock band doomed to remain a cult act. Dreaming of adoring crowds and hit records, Buchanan sings with appropriate joie de vivre, but even on his first single, he sounds more like a veteran actor portraying a teenager. He has the type of pained, dignified voice, like \\u003Ca href=\\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fpitchfork.com\\u002Fartists\\u002F5095-frank-sinatra\\u002F\\"\\u003EFrank Sinatra\\u003C\\u002Fa\\u003E or \\u003Ca href=\\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fpitchfork.com\\u002Fartists\\u002F696-johnny-cash\\u002F\\"\\u003EJohnny Cash\\u003C\\u002Fa\\u003E, that makes it hard to imagine him ever actually being young. \xe2\x80\x9cI know I\xe2\x80\x99m going out of style,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings and immediately asks, \xe2\x80\x9cAm I already out of style?\xe2\x80\x9d The song, paired with a downbeat B-side called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Second Act,\xe2\x80\x9d became a self-fulfilling prophecy as the band continued in relative obscurity.\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ETheir debut album, \\u003Cem\\u003EA Walk Across the Rooftops\\u003C\\u002Fem\\u003E, arrived in 1984 via the stereo equipment company Linn, who were looking to expand their reach by starting a label. (\xe2\x80\x9cLinn weren\xe2\x80\x99t a record company and we weren\xe2\x80\x99t a band,\xe2\x80\x9d Buchanan would later reflect in Elliot J. Huntley and Edith Hall\xe2\x80\x99s biography \\u003Cem\\u003EFrom a Late Night Train\\u003C\\u002Fem\\u003E.) Still, their unusual working relationship allowed the members of the Blue Nile to record in Linn\xe2\x80\x99s studios and operate without a strict deadline. As so often happens with our first brushes of love, the band chased this experience the rest of their career. No pressure and no expectations\xe2\x80\x94a creative process they could be instinctive about.\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhittled down to seven songs, \\u003Cem\\u003EA Walk Across the Rooftops\\u003C\\u002Fem\\u003E is a stately record that established the Blue Nile\xe2\x80\x99s sound\xe2\x80\x94a sprawling, sophisticated strain of ambient synth pop\xe2\x80\x94and their major themes. \xe2\x80\x9cI am in love with a feeling,\xe2\x80\x9d Buchanan sings in \xe2\x80\x9cFrom Rags to Riches.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIs there a place in this city\\u002FA place to always feel this way,\xe2\x80\x9d he asks in \xe2\x80\x9cTinseltown in the Rain,\xe2\x80\x9d a minor hit in Holland and the closest thing the Blue Nile have to a signature song. The album, punctuated by Bell\xe2\x80\x99s slap bass and a vibrant backdrop of keys and guitars, dazzled critics and established a small audience of devoted fans.\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EInstead of rushing to make a follow-up, the Blue Nile studied where their music had taken them, as they traveled through America and Europe. \xe2\x80\x9c[O]ne of the best things we saw in our first trip to London,\xe2\x80\x9d Buchanan told \\u003Cem\\u003ENME\\u003C\\u002Fem\\u003E after the album\xe2\x80\x99s release, \xe2\x80\x9cWas a guy and a girl standing in Oxford Street\xe2\x80\xa6 They were obviously having a moment\xe2\x80\x94breaking up or something, something that was wrong\xe2\x80\x94and you just looked at it and knew the feeling. It was a brilliant reminder of what\xe2\x80\x99s worth all the hassle.\xe2\x80\x9d\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt was an omen. The five years between \\u003Cem\\u003EA Walk Across the Rooftops\\u003C\\u002Fem\\u003E and \\u003Cem\\u003EHats\\u003C\\u002Fem\\u003E were trying times for the band. Relationships, both romantic and professional, crumbled around them. An album\xe2\x80\x99s worth of material was scrapped\xe2\x80\x94the feeling just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there\xe2\x80\x94and the tapes were burned. Witnessing the dissolution of his parents\xe2\x80\x99 decades-long marriage, Buchanan\xe2\x80\x99s writing became increasingly sparse and tormented, like Raymond Carver stories stretched into the shape of torch ballads.\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAt his mother\xe2\x80\x99s house, Buchanan tracked a new song called \xe2\x80\x9cChristmas\xe2\x80\x9d that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t end up making the record. Its lyrics are a portrait of the least romantic kind of adult despair: money running out, children crying. But the song is a balm, smoother and sweeter than anything the band had ever recorded. At one point, Buchanan plays an uncharacteristic guitar solo and hums along sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cTake it easy,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings as if to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI still love you. I believe in you.\xe2\x80\x9d\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis is the tone of \\u003Cem\\u003EHats\\u003C\\u002Fem\\u003E: a series of hard-won love songs written like no one was in the room. Despite its long incubation, the music arrived fairly quickly once the band established its arc. The song that opened the creative floodgates was \xe2\x80\x9cThe Downtown Lights,\xe2\x80\x9d a rush of images and emotions that flows at the deliberate pace of a steady walk through snow. Buchanan\xe2\x80\x99s guitar has hints of \\u003Ca href=\\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fpitchfork.com\\u002Fartists\\u002F29395-nile-rodgers\\u002F\\"\\u003ENile Rodgers\\u003C\\u002Fa\\u003E\xe2\x80\x99 palm-muted funk; Bell\xe2\x80\x99s bass slides where it once popped. By the end of the song, Buchanan is bellowing and the band is locked into an airtight stride, accompanied by a string section woven so closely to the lyrics you might think they\xe2\x80\x99re daydreaming it.\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDespite the movement of the music, \\u003Cem\\u003EHats\\u003C\\u002Fem\\u003E is an album in stasis. The Blue Nile understand that, like all good theater, relationships are inextricably linked to their setting, and the characters on \\u003Cem\\u003EHats\\u003C\\u002Fem\\u003E are prisoners to it, escaping only in fantasy. \xe2\x80\x9cWalk me into town\\u002FThe ferry will be there to carry us away into the air,\xe2\x80\x9d Buchanan sings in \xe2\x80\x9cOver the Hillside.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s walk in the cool evening light\\u002FWrong or right\\u002FBe at my side,\xe2\x80\x9d he pleads in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Downtown Lights.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI pray for love coming out all right,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings in the climactic final verse of \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s Go Out Tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he cries out the title as one final desperate attempt to save something that\xe2\x80\x99s already gone.\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe magic of \\u003Cem\\u003EHats\\u003C\\u002Fem\\u003E is how the music makes defeat sound euphoric. Depending on your mood, \\u003Cem\\u003EHats\\u003C\\u002Fem\\u003E can be an uplifting album (\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right\xe2\x80\x9d serves as its rallying cry) or a uniquely devastating one. These are multi-dimensional portraits: colorful cities populated by lonely people, romantic gestures received by silence, beautiful evenings going nowhere. The most immediate tracks on the album shift between moods like a plane dipping through clouds. \xe2\x80\x9cHeadlights on the Parade\xe2\x80\x9d rides its glowing new wave groove while Buchanan prods a lover that something isn\xe2\x80\x99t right. \xe2\x80\x9cOver the Hillside\xe2\x80\x9d begins with a sad hospital pulse and his depictions of a long, sleepless night, but it transcends to feel like an invitation, like elegance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\\u003Ca href=\\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.youtube.com\\u002Fwatch?v=x5kXnq5IjdU\\"\\u003EThunder Road\\u003C\\u002Fa\\u003E\xe2\x80\x9d in a luxury car. \xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow I will be there,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings proudly at the end, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you wait and see.\xe2\x80\x9d On some listens, you believe him.\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe Blue Nile are a band whose criticisms only draw fans closer.

You carve out a place to hear \\u003Cem\\u003EHats\\u003C\\u002Fem\\u003E; you confide it in other people. An oft-repeated legend about the band involves Paul Buchanan at a Glasgow bar shortly after the release of their debut album. As he downs a few pints among the locals, the conversation turns to music, and someone recommends him a great new band from the area. They\xe2\x80\x99re called the Blue Nile, they say. You\xe2\x80\x99ll love them, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got their tape in my car.\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe anecdote illustrates the overarching philosophy for Buchanan\xe2\x80\x99s art, to be removed from it completely. \xe2\x80\x9c[Y]ou hope that someday in the future some kid will be walking along the beach and find a little piece of green glass that has been worn down by the waves,\xe2\x80\x9d he once explained to \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Sydney Morning Herald\\u003C\\u002Fem\\u003E. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll pick it up and put it in his pocket, take it home and love it. He won\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily know why he loves it, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll love it. Those are the kind of records we try to make.\xe2\x80\x9d In another version of this metaphor, he relates a boy and a girl watching a film on their first date: \xe2\x80\x9cThey are much more important to each other, hopefully, than the movie is to either one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAt the core of \\u003Cem\\u003EHats\\u003C\\u002Fem\\u003E is a heartbroken song called \xe2\x80\x9cFrom a Late Night Train,\xe2\x80\x9d featuring just piano, trumpet, and Buchanan\xe2\x80\x99s vocals, all combining to sound like rain on the windshield of a parked car. \xe2\x80\x9cI know it\xe2\x80\x99s over,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings in a low, beaten voice, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I love you so.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s a song that illustrates the stakes of love, sung in the final moments of a relationship when there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing left to say but the inevitable. On a record filled with questions\xe2\x80\x94Where is the love? What\xe2\x80\x99s so wrong tonight?
